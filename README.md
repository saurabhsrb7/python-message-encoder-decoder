# python-message-encoder-decoder

This objective of this project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. This project will be built using the Tkinter and base64 library.
In this project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode. Users have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.


*Project Prerequisites*
To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.

Tkinter is a standard GUI python library
base64 module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.

To install the library we use pip install command on the command prompt

pip install tkinter
pip install base64

*Project File Structure*
These are the step to build message encode – decode python project

Import module
Create display window
Define function
Define labels and buttons
So this is what we will do in this python project. Let’s start
